[Academy](https://www.hackthebox.eu/home/machines/profile/297) is a easy rated Linux room on Hackthebox by [egre55](https://www.hackthebox.eu/home/users/profile/1190) and [mrb3n](https://www.hackthebox.eu/home/users/profile/2984). We make use a CVE on Laravel to get a shell on the box as user www-data. Credential found from `.env` file of  the webserver is reused by user cry0l1t3 which was used to get the shell. User cry0l1t3 was on adm group and aureport was installed on the box which gave use the credentials for another user mrb3n. mrb3n can run composer as root which was exploited to get root shell on the box.

There are three ports open. SSH is running on port 22, HTTP service on port 80 and Nmap guesses that the service running on port 33060 might be mysqlx.

# HTTP Service on Port 80
![1](/assets/images/htb-boxes/academy/1.png)
We get redirected to [http://academy.htb](http://academy.htb). 

So let us add the entry to out `/etc/hosts` file.

```console
10.10.10.215   academy.htb
```

## Visiting academy.htb

## Directory and file bruteforcing
```console
reddevil@ubuntu:~/Documents/htb/boxes/academy$ gobuster dir -u http://academy.htb -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -x php,txt,html

/images (Status: 301)
/index.php (Status: 200)
/home.php (Status: 302)
/login.php (Status: 200)
/register.php (Status: 200)
/admin.php (Status: 200)
/config.php (Status: 200) 
```
We can see that the `home.php` have a redirection of status 302 which is a temporary redirection. Maybe we must be logged in to view the page and all other pages have a status code of 200.

## Registering a user and intercepting the request with Burp
![3](/assets/images/htb-boxes/academy/3.png)
One interesting thing while registering is the **roleid** parameter which value is set to 0. After registering we get a 302 redirection to a **success-page.php**.

## Logging in 
![4](/assets/images/htb-boxes/academy/4.png)
We log in and only thing that I find interesting on this page is the username which might come handy later. So let us take a note of that.

## Checking admin.php
![5](/assets/images/htb-boxes/academy/5.png)
I tried to login with the credentials that I used to login before. But I was unsuccessful. Then I thought of **roleid** parameter whose value was set to 0 and decided to register a new user with value of roleid set to 1.

## Registering a new user
![6](/assets/images/htb-boxes/academy/6.png)

## Logging on admin.php
![7](/assets/images/htb-boxes/academy/7.png)
This time we are logged in as admin. We can see we have two different usernames and a new hostname. So I added that to my host file.

## Visiting dev-staging-01.academy.htb
![8](/assets/images/htb-boxes/academy/8.png)
We are presented with what looks like laravel debug page. On the same page we are presented with whole bunch of information.

![9](/assets/images/htb-boxes/academy/9.png)

Then I searched and found that there is a remote code execution vulnerability on laravel.

## SearchSploit
```console
reddevil@ubuntu:~/Documents/htb/boxes/academy$ searchsploit laravel

## Firing Up Metasploit and getting a reverse shell
![10](/assets/images/htb-boxes/academy/10.png)
We have eveything that is needed to run this exploit. 

### Running the exploit
![11](/assets/images/htb-boxes/academy/11.png)
We get a shell as www-data.

# Privilege Escalation
As I was manually browsing and looking at the contents of the webservers, I found credentials for the database.
![12](/assets/images/htb-boxes/academy/12.png)

## Listing users on the box
![13](/assets/images/htb-boxes/academy/13.png)

So lets try that password for every user.
## SSH password bruteforcing with hydra
```console
reddevil@ubuntu:~/Documents/htb/boxes/academy$ hydra -L user -P pass ssh://academy.htb
Hydra v9.0 (c) 2019 by van Hauser/THC - Please do not use in military or secret service organizations, or for illegal purposes.

Hydra (https://github.com/vanhauser-thc/thc-hydra) starting at 2021-02-27 14:54:53
[WARNING] Many SSH configurations limit the number of parallel tasks, it is recommended to reduce the tasks: use -t 4

```

We get a hit. So let us login on the box using SSH as user cry0l1t3.

## Logging as user mrb3n
```console
reddevil@ubuntu:~/Documents/htb/boxes/academy$ ssh cry0l1t3@academy.htb
cry0l1t3@academy.htb's password:

```
We are on adm group which means we can read important log files like auth.log,syslog etc.

## Reading user flag
```console
cry0l1t3@academy:~$ cat user.txt

```

## Uploading linpeas using scp
```console
reddevil@ubuntu:~/Documents/htb/boxes/academy$ scp linpeas.sh cry0l1t3@academy.htb:/dev/shm/linpeas.sh
cry0l1t3@academy.htb's password: 
linpeas.sh   
```

## Running linpeas on the box
![15](/assets/images/htb-boxes/academy/15.png)

We get a password for user mrb3n.

## Shell as mrb3n
```console
cry0l1t3@academy:~$ su mrb3n
Password: 
$ id
uid=1001(mrb3n) gid=1001(mrb3n) groups=1001(mrb3n)
```
And we succesfully log in.

# Checking sudo -l
```console
mrb3n@academy:/home/cry0l1t3$ sudo -l
[sudo] password for mrb3n: 
Matching Defaults entries for mrb3n on academy:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User mrb3n may run the following commands on academy:
    (ALL) /usr/bin/composer
```
Our user can run composer as root. So, let us check this on [gtfobins](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/composer/#sudo) if we can use this to get a root shell on the box and it turns out we can.
