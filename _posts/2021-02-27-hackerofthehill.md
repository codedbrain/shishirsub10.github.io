[Hacker of the hill](https://tryhackme.com/room/hackerofthehill) is a room in Tryhackme platform which consists of three sets of challenges machines, (easy linux box, medium rated windows box and hard rated linux box). For each submitted flag to the hackerone platform, we get a private bug bounty invitation.

I will be posting the full writeup for this room once the challenge ends. Ping me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/Shishir37768334) if you have genuine questions regarding the challenge.
