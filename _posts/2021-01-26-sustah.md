[Sustah](https://tryhackme.com/room/sustah) is a medium rated linux room in Tryhackme by [kiransau](https://tryhackme.com/p/kiransau). Rate limiting was present on the webserver while bruteforcing which was bypassed to get a name of hidden directory which contained MaraCMS. Then a publicly available exploit for MaraCMS is used to get shell on the box as www-data. On the box, a backup file containing password for user kiran was found which also had privilege to run rsync as user root which was used to get a root shell on the box.

We have three ports open. One being SSH on port 22 and other two have HTTP service running on port 80 and port 8085.

# Checking Port 80
![1](/assets/images/thm/sustah/1.png)
The homepage contains a image and a quote by Buddha.

# Directory Bruteforcing
![2](/assets/images/thm/sustah/2.png)

Since we do not find any hidden directories, lets visit HTTP server on port 8085.

# Visiting Port 8085
![3](/assets/images/thm/sustah/3.png)

It says us to guess the number and also says that our chance of winning is only 0.004%. So, lets make a guess and analyze the response on BurpSuite.

## Guessing a number
![4](/assets/images/thm/sustah/4.png)

Looking at the response headers, it looks like we can not guess the right number by bruteforcing as there is rate limiting on the form. So, I searched around to check if this rate limiting check can be bypassed.
And I found this article on [hacktricks](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting-web/rate-limit-bypass) which says that we can bypass the rate limiting by using custom headers like
```console
X-Originating-IP: 127.0.0.1
X-Forwarded-For: 127.0.0.1
X-Remote-IP: 127.0.0.1
X-Remote-Addr: 127.0.0.1
X-Client-IP: 127.0.0.1
X-Host: 127.0.0.1
X-Forwared-Host: 127.0.0.1

#or use double X-Forwared-For header
X-Forwarded-For:
X-Forwarded-For: 127.0.0.1
```
So, I tried each of the headers manually and `X-Remote-Addr: 127.0.0.1` did the trick.

![5](/assets/images/thm/sustah/5.png)

## Bruteforcing the number using wfuzz
```console
reddevil@ubuntu:~/Documents/tryhackme/sustah$ wfuzz -w numbers --hh 1004 -c -H 'X-Remote-Addr: 127.0.0.1' -d 'number=FUZZ' -u http://10.10.194.3:8085/

And we get a different response for number 10921.

## Analysing response on Burp
![6](/assets/images/thm/sustah/6.png)
And we get a path for a hidden directory.

## Visiting the path
![7](/assets/images/thm/sustah/7.png)

MaraCMS is installed on the webserver. As this is publicly availble, I checked whether there are publicly availble vulnerabilities on MaraCMS. And I found one on [exploitdb](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/48780) which is authenticated remote code execution by uploading a PHP file on the webserver. The exploit was released on 2020-08-31 and for version 7.5. So, the chances are that the CMS that the host is running might be vulnerable.

Also the problem here is we have to be authenticated to run this exploit.

Clicking around on the webserver, I land on the page with the default credentials.
![8](/assets/images/thm/sustah/8.png)

Let's try to login with the given creds.

## Trying to login
![9](/assets/images/thm/sustah/9.png)
![10](/assets/images/thm/sustah/10.png)
And we login successfully. 
While searching around I found a changes.txt file containing the version of the MaraCMS running.
![21](/assets/images/thm/sustah/21.png)

Now, we can upload a php reverse shell, execute it on the webserver and can get a reverse shell.

## Uploading a reverse shell
![11](/assets/images/thm/sustah/11.png)

The file is successfully uploaded to the home directory of the MaraCMS.

## Getting a reverse shell
![12](/assets/images/thm/sustah/12.png)
And we get a shell back and we are running as www-data user.

# Privilege Escalation

## Running linpeas.sh 
From the output of linpeas, I found a backup file containing password for user kiran.
![13](/assets/images/thm/sustah/13.png)

Let's see if the user kiran is using same password.
![14](/assets/images/thm/sustah/14.png)
And we get a shell on the box as kiran.

## Running linpeas again
![15](/assets/images/thm/sustah/15.png)
Our user kiran can run rsync with root privileges. Let's check on [gtfobins](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/rsync/#sudo) if this can be used for privilege escalation.
![16](/assets/images/thm/sustah/16.png)
And it turns out we can.

## Getting a root shell
![17](/assets/images/thm/sustah/17.png)
And we get a root shell.
